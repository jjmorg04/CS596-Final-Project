# Game Description
Our final project is a mobile pinball game built in Unity 3D, designed to recreate the traditional pinball game with modern features like mobile sensors and environmental triggers. The player/user launches a pinball using a pull to shoot button, then taps on either side of the screen to control the left and right flippers. The goal is the same as the traditional pinball game to keep the ball in play for as long as possible, rack up as many points by hitting bumpers, ramps, bonus zones, and trigger special effects through collisions with target objects. We implemented a moving shader for the title of the game. We learned this in one of our projects earlier in the semester.

The gameplay will incorporate real-time physics to simulate pinball mechanics. We plan to use Unity's physics engine for collision, gravity, and bounce effects. Players can also tilt their phone left or right to subtly influence the ball's path (like "nudging" in real pinball). We will try implementing functions like hitting certain objects to spawn objects. Scoring will be based on these interactions and the game ends when the ball falls through the drain without being caught.

The game will feature several sound effects for flipper activation, bumper collisions, launching the ball, and score multipliers to enhance gameplay.

# Group Organization
Jett Morgan - Worked on mobile input controls (tap for flippers, pinch zoom in/out, two-finger pan around, tilt cheating), board layout and artwork, ball mechanics, custom shader. Handled sound effects and event scripting. Helped with UI design and logic for start/end game screens and scoreboard.

Steven Gervacio - Handles readme, UI/UX, scoring system, and on-screen elements like score and ball count. Helped with plunger and aesthetic of the game.

Aaron Maryfield- Handles game physics for the plunger and input controls. Built borders for pinball game. Helped with bumpers and tap features.

Gerardo Gutierrez -  Handles the board grooves and audio

We are in constant communication through discord and all members understand the general design and pipeline.

# Grading Rubric
Graphics: 10% - 
Shown in video

Sound: 10% -
We use sounds for the ball hitting objects like plunger, wall, bumpers, score circles, etc.
No background music

Gameplay: 20% -
Pinball gameplay as shown in video

Fun factor: 10% -
Titling your phone to make the ball go in the direction of the tilt. Resizing the pinball machine on your phone my pinching. Score adding for the gameplay.

X-Factor: 25% This can be anything! -
We did mobile gameplay with a custom shader for the game.

Project/Code quality: 25% -
