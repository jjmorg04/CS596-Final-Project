# Game Description
Our final project is a mobile pinball game built in Unity 3D, designed to recreate the traditional pinball game with modern features like mobile sensors, environmental triggers, and potential VR integration. The player/user launches a pinball using a pull to shoot button, then taps on either side of the screen to control the left and right flippers. The goal is the same as the traditional pinball game to keep the ball in play for as long as possible, rack up as many points by hitting bumpers, ramps, bonus zones, and trigger special effects through collisions with target objects.

The gameplay will incorporate real-time physics to simulate pinball mechanics. We plan to use Unity's physics engine for collision, gravity, and bounce effects. Players can also tilt their phone left or right to subtly influence the ball's path (like "nudging" in real pinball). We will try implementing functions like hitting certain objects to spawn temporary challenges or bonuses such as activating a slow-motion zone and triggering multiple balls. Scoring will be based on these interactions and the game ends when the ball falls through the drain without being caught.

We will also explore VR integration using a mobile VR headset adapter, allowing the player to experience pinball in a first-person perspective. This mode would be the “X-Factor” feature. The game will feature several sound effects for flipper activation, bumper collisions, launching the ball, and score multipliers to enhance gameplay.

# Group Organization
Jett Morgan - Handles sound effects and event scripting. Will create audio triggers, setup audio sources.

Steven Gervacio - Handles readme, UI/UX, scoring system, and on-screen elements like scoreand ball count.

Aaron Maryfield- Handles game physics and input controls. This includes ball movement, flipper mechanics, collision detection, and tilting.

Gerardo Gutierrez -  Responsible for art and scene design, pinball table layout, 3D models, lighting, and materials. 

We are in constant communication through discord and all members understand the general design and pipeline.

# Assistance / Concerns / Notes to TA:
We may need assistance in the following areas:

* Optimizing ball physics for mobile devices to ensure consistency.

* If we pursue VR, we may need guidance on setting up Unity’s plugins for mobile VR.

* Feedback on the best way to implement bonus mechanics.
